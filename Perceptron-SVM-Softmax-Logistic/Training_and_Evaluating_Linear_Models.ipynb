Perceptron classifier and explored the effects of two key hyperparameters: learning rate and number of training epochs. Through experimentation and tuning, I was able to observe how these parameters influenced model performance and convergence behavior.\n","\n","The implementation was developed in **models/perceptron.py**.\n","\n","### Hyperparameter 1: Learning rate\n","The learning rate determines the magnitude of weight updates during training. I began with a default value of 0.5 and experimented with a range of values from 0.0005 to 5.0 to study their impact on accuracy and training dynamics.\n","\n","Hereâ€™s what I found:\n","* High learning rates (e.g., 0.5 or above) sometimes caused the model to diverge or exhibit unstable loss patterns. Reducing the rate by a factor of 10 (e.g., from 0.5 to 0.05) helped stabilize training.\n","* Low learning rates led to very slow convergence. In such cases, increasing the rate (e.g., from 0.005 to 0.05) improved training speed.\n","* I also experimented with learning rate decay by reducing the learning rate gradually over epochs (e.g., multiplying by 0.95 after each epoch), which helped fine-tune the model as training progressed.\n","* To visualize the effect of different learning rates, I plotted training and validation accuracy across epochs.\n","\n","### Hyperparameter 2: Number of Epochs\n","An epoch refers to one full pass through the training dataset, where the model makes predictions and updates weights according to the Perceptron update rule.\n","\n","To evaluate convergence, I:\n","* Monitored accuracy trends on both the training and validation sets.\n","* Increased the number of epochs when I noticed that accuracy plateaued early or the model failed to converge.\n","* Compared performance across different values of epochs to find an optimal balance between training time and accuracy.\n","\n","These hyperparameter experiments provided valuable insights into the sensitivity of the Perceptron model and helped me better understand how to tune simple neural classifiers for improved performance."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_n1mxeX-ZG7r"},"source":["## Train Perceptron on
